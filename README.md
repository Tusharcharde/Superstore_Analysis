Total Sales: ~$2.3 Million

Total Profit: ~$286K

Total Orders: ~9,994

Avg. Profit Margin: ~12.2%

 Insight: While sales volume is healthy, the profit margin (~12%) indicates thin profitability, likely affected by discounting and product mix.

 2. Category vs. Profit Chart
Technology is the most profitable category, showing high sales and positive profit.

Furniture, especially Tables, contributes to significant losses, despite moderate sales.

Consumer segment brings the most orders and revenue.

Corporate segment, while smaller in volume, shows better profitability per order.

Home Office has the lowest total profit, suggesting less loyal or high-cost customers.

 Insight: Shift focus toward Corporate clients, who are more cost-effective, and refine strategies for Home Office users.

 4. Ship Mode Distribution
Standard Class dominates shipments but is less profitable.

Second Class and First Class show better balance between volume and profit.

Same Day shipping has the least usage, possibly due to higher cost and limited availability.

 Insight: Consider cost-benefit analysis for expanding efficient ship modes and minimizing overuse of unprofitable ones.

 5. Regional Performance (Map & Chart)
West and East regions contribute the most to profit.

Central region posts the most consistent losses, especially in Furniture.

South region is in the mid-range, with some profitable cities but others with losses.

 Insight: Prioritize marketing and inventory optimization in West/East, while reassessing product-market fit in Central.

 6. Discount Impact
Products with higher discounts (>20%) often show losses.

Minimal or no-discount orders generate the highest profits, especially in Technology.

 Insight: Avoid blanket discounting. Use data-driven targeted offers to maintain margins.

 Strategic Recommendations
 Reduce or restructure discounts, especially on Furniture and Central region products.

 Strengthen focus on Corporate clients with tailored product bundles.

 Optimize shipping mix: Promote cost-effective modes and review Same Day profitability.

 Phase out or reprice underperforming sub-categories like Tables and Bookcases.

 Expand successful models in West & East regions to similar cities.
